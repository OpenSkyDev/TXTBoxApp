### Welcome

This is ==TXTBox==.  Your stupid simple notes app.

It supports some [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for style as you type.

All your notes are listed under __All Notes__.  You can also browse by __Tags__ that can be found in the sidebar.

##### Tags

Tags are created __inline__ with your note text.  Just add two curly braces around the word, or words.  For example, this note is taged {{Welcome}}

Tag names are case insensitive.  So {{welcome}} is the same as {{Welcome}}.

##### Markdown

The inline highlighting is supported for a few markdown tags.

- `>`

> Block quotes for example.

- `###`  Headers are bolded
- `inline code style`
- [Links](http://www.txtbox.co)
- `__bold__` Bold
- `**bold**` Bold
- `~~strike~~` Strike through

Thanks very much for trying out TXTBox.  I hope you enjoy it.
